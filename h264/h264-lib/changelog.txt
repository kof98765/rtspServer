[2005-3-29]
New function:
1, B frame deblock. [decoder]
2, Add sse2/sse/mmx support for Pixel_avg. [encoder/decoder]
3, rewrite sad + interpolation asm. [encoder]
4, cabac encoder and decoder support.
5, rewrite deblock for speed.
6, rewrite p skip detection routine. [encoder]
7, scene detection added. [encoder]
8, dshow wrapper update.

Fixed bugs:
1, bitstream rbsp_training_bits bug. [encoder]
2, ratecontrol for b slice. [encoder]
3, fixed direct mode for b slice. [encoder]
4, bitstream decoder may be error between emulation prevention code. [decoder]
5, reorder frames bug. [decoder]

[2004-12-15]
1, i16x16 decoder support
2, dshow encoder + decoder + splitter support

[2004-12-3]
1, new fast interpolation introduced
2, p slice decoder complete
3, port to linux

[2004-11-17]
1, b slice 16x8 + 8x16 introduced
2, multiple previous frames used for inter introduced(speed dropped)

[2004-11-9]
1, introduce new flag: USE_INTRAININTER, when it is off, speed may be up 5 fps(3ks chenm)
2, redesign plugin structure, stat(include psnr now can display by set the enable psnr in
   enconfig.txt)
3, change the header file t264.h and then it is friendly to use maybe
4, change the directory layout, decoder will import

[2004-11-6]
b frame partial implement

[2004-10-26]
1, subpel search increase from 4 pel to 8 pel
2, ratecontrol can be enble by set enable rate control to 1 in enconfig.txt
   in T264.exe or set bitrate great than 0 in T264 dshow encoder.

[2004-10-22]
1, optimized deblock filter
2, optimized detect p-skip subroutine
3, add i4x4 mode3-8, except mode 3 & 7
4, add interpolate_h/v_sse2, gain minor speed
5, update ratecontrol mad model, but still not satisfied
6, update me thresholds, increase the compression ratio
7, limit ratecontrol min/max qp to prevent the quality decrease fearfully
